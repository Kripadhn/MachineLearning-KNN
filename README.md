K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs): KNNs are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for image recognition. They are designed to classify images based on the similarity of their features to other images in the dataset. The following is an example of a simple KNN model in Python using the scikit-learn library:

In the example shown above following steps are performed:

1. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm is imported from the scikit-learn package.
2. Create feature and target variables.
3. Split data into training and test data.
4. Generate a k-NN model using neighbors value.
5. Train or fit the data into the model.
6. Predict the future.
